# New Event Palmetto Flow Helper

Creating new events using palmetto flow helpers.

This exercise is an extension of the previous, instead of
building the service, we are going to build a client and
the adventure will take care of the service for us:

We want to get a list of widgets, from the `widgets/list` service.

First, we want to install `palmettoflow-event` and `palmettoflow-nodejs`

    npm install palmettoflow-event
    npm install palmettoflow-nodejs

Next, we want to create our `client.js` file:

    var palmetto = require('palmettoflow-nodejs')
    var newEvent = require('palmettoflow-event').newEvent

    var ee = palmetto()

    var ne = newEvent('widgets', 'list', {})

    var to = setTimeout(function () {
      console.log('Service did not respond')
    }, 500)

    ee.once(ne.from, function (e) {
      clearTimeout(to)
      console.log(e.object)
    })

    ee.emit('send', ne)

So, what we are requesting a list of widgets and logging the widgets out to the console.

Once finished with building your event emitter run

    palmetto-adventure run main.js

And when you are ready to complete this exercise run

    palmetto-adventure verify main.js

Lastly, to move to the next exercise run

    palmetto-adventure
