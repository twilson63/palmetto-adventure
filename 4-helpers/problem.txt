# Palmetto Flow Helpers

Generating events and responses can become pretty tedious, using `palmettoflow-event` module and following a basic standard you can take advantage of some helper functions to make the event messaging management very easy:

Palmettoflow-event contains three methods:

- newEvent
- response
- responseError

## newEvent (subject, verb, object, [actor])

With newEvent you can pass in a subject, verb, payload, and optional actor.

    var ne = newEvent('widgets', 'create', { name: 'my widget'})

creates:

    {
      to: '/widgets/create',
      from: '{generated unique id}',
      subject: 'widgets',
      verb: 'create',
      object: { name: 'my widget' }
      dateSubmitted: '{generated date}'
    }

usage example:

    var ne = newEvent('widgets', 'create', { name: 'my widget'})
    ee.on(ne.from, handleEvent)
    ee.emit('send', ne)

## response (event, object)

The response event takes a existing event and prepares a response event based no the event being passed in, for example, if the event was like this:

    var event = {
      to: '/widgets/create',
      from: '{generated unique id}',
      subject: 'widgets',
      verb: 'create',
      object: { name: 'my widget' }
      dateSubmitted: '{generated date}'
    }

then

    var response = require('palmettoflow-event').response
    var re = response(event, { ok: true })

would create a response event that looked like this:

    var event = {
      from: '/widgets/create',
      to: '{generated unique id}',
      subject: 'widgets-response',
      verb: 'create-response',
      object: { ok: true }
      dateSubmitted: '{generated date}',
      duration: 100
    }

It basically swaps the to and from and calcuates the duration as well as append the reponse text to the subject and verb.

## responseError (event, object)

Does the same thing as response, but appends the subject and verb with error instead of response.

In this exercise, lets create a widgets service that creates a widget by storing it in an array and returns ok true as response using the response method from `palmettoflow-event`

When we build services, we want them to be as flexable as possible, so we want to pass in the `ee` object to the module, this will enable the object to be any kind of adapter:

First, we want to install the `palmettoflow-event` module

    npm install palmettoflow-event

Next, lets create a `widgets.js` file and add the following:

    var response = require('palmettoflow-event').response

    var widgets = []

    module.exports = function (ee) {
      ee.on('/widgets/create', function (e) {
        widgets.push(e.object)
        ee.emit('send', response(e, { ok: true }))
      })
    }

Once finished with building your event emitter run

    palmetto-adventure run main.js

And when you are ready to complete this exercise run

    palmetto-adventure verify main.js

Lastly, to move to the next exercise run
