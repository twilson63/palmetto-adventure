# 2- palmettoflow-nodejs adapter

PalmettoFlow uses pub/sub as the core bridge between services and components, in order to make it easy to 
replace pub/sub bridges, PalmettoFlow has `adapters`
these adapters abstract the specific pub/sub bridge away from the developer, so the developer may code as if they
are connecting to an `EventEmitter`.

In this exercise, we want to use the palmettoflow-nodejs adapter to send a PalmettoFlow Event from the client to the service. 

Don't worry about understanding a PalmettoFlow `event` right now.

First, we need to install the `palmettoflow-nodejs` adapter

    npm install palmettoflow-nodejs

Next, create a file called `2.js` or your preference and require the `palmettoflow-nodejs` module:

    var palmetto = require('palmettoflow-nodejs')
    var ee = palmetto()

Next, create a listener for a particular service/verb:

    ee.on('/widgets/list', function (e) {
      console.log('WIDGETS')
    })

Finally, we will send an event message to this service:

    ee.emit('send', {
      to: '/widgets/list',
      from: '1234',
      object: {}
    })

Once finished with building your event emitter run 

    palmetto-adventure run main.js

And when you are ready to complete this exercise run

    palmetto-adventure verify main.js

Lastly, to move to the next exercise run

    palmetto-adventure
